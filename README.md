Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models: a guide for evaluating large-scale health interventions

The article provides a guide for conducting interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA models, aimed at evaluating large-scale health interventions. It explains the methodology step-by-step, using Australian medicine dispensing claims as an example. The study focuses on the impact of policy changes on quetiapine dispensing. It discusses data transformation, model selection, residual checks, and model interpretation. The article also emphasizes the importance of considering trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation in health policy evaluation and offers insights on the broader application of ITS analysis in public health research.
